<h2>Gender Equality in the 21st Century

<p><em>Has meaningful equality between the sexes been attained, or are important discriminations still a burden to our society?</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Although the social status of women in Western societies now seems to be almost equal to that of men, in my opinion I believe that we as a society have a long way to go before we can achieve social equity and truly equal treatment between the sexes. Indeed, we should be grateful for the hard work of the feminist movement that has aided us in attaining a dynamic role in society. However, I believe that there are still characteristics of our society that in reality make it more male-dominated than equal. Nowadays, I am of the opinion that women are discriminated against by society in two main sectors, first professionally and secondly in their personal lives.
</p>
<p>First of all, on a professional level, women are discriminated against in the financial sector, but also in the field of professional success and advancement. Initially, despite existing legislation, women are often paid less than men for the same job. For example, according to Payscale, in 2019 in the United States, on average, a woman was paid 79 cents for every dollar a man earned. In addition, discrimination against women of childbearing age (25-35 years old) is quite common, resulting in their not being hired by the employer, especially in the private sector. In Europe, this happens mainly because the employer wishes to avoid maternity leave costs. At the same time, in more extreme cases, women can sometimes be fired if they become pregnant, even though it is technically illegal.
</p>
<p>Still, it is more difficult for a woman to succeed in her career by securing high positions in business, management or government, since only 4.8% of CEOs of S&P 500 companies are female[₁]. Also, in terms of political representation, only 5 of the 51 members of the Greek government and 61 of the 300 representatives are women, even though they make up 51% of the population. Nevertheless, we must emphasize that for the first time since the establishment of the Greek state in 1830, a woman is President of the Republic[₂]. It is worth noting, however, that this is not so much because of pure discrimination against the female sex, but because most women do not dare to take positions in areas that have been considered male-dominated for centuries.
</p>
<p>Likewise, on a personal level, women face acts of discrimination and negative comments on a daily basis. First of all, stereotypes that a woman needs to have a partner and children in order to be happy and successful in her social life have not yet been debunked. However, there are also new stereotypes that have been created in recent years that underestimate women who do not wish to pursue a career. Furthermore, in regard to sexual harassment, which is a major issue today with the creation of the Me Too movement, women constitute, once again, for the most part, the victims. 55% of women in the European Union report having been sexually harassed[₃]. Consequently, 85% of victims of sexual harassment are women, while 15% are men[₄]. Finally, in many instances in their daily lives, women face misogynistic behavior, although most of the time it is no longer clearly expressed but underlies various actions, habits or phrases of men but also women.
</p>
<p>In my opinion, the only way to achieve meaningful equality between the sexes and to transcend the theoretical equality that exists in our time is to radically change our mentality. This must begin with the overthrow of misogynistic stereotypes that harm women psychologically. It is important that we as humans respect our fellow human beings, whatever their gender. It is also necessary that we learn not to criticize others for their behavior as long as it does not harm us personally. Furthermore, it would also be useful for hostilities between the sexes to cease at every level, from bitter comments to gender-based violence. All this can be achieved with the help of proper education. Ultimately, it is necessary to really understand that although we are not all the same, we deserve to be treated equally and fairly by our fellow human beings and at the same time treat others the same way.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is worth emphasizing that despite the problems that exist today between the sexes, positive changes have taken place in recent decades that have rapidly improved the state of our society. Thus, we can hope that achieving genuine gender equality is feasible.
